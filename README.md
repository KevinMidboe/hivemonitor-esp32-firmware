# Architecture

![hivemonitor architecture drawing](https://github.com/KevinMidboe/hivemonitor-esp32-firmware/assets/2287769/c40512e5-9f31-4aea-a8db-e92646c51903)

# Operating modes

## Setup mode
Both types of devices acting as `sending` and `gateway` have a operating and setup mode. By using the on-board switch labeled "MODE" the esp32 will boot up in setup mode and be available as a WiFi hotspot named `ESP-AP-*`. View [setup section](#setup) below.

## Sender device
Devices acting as sensor have weight, temperature and humidity sensors connected that will be read and broadcasted using ESP-NOW peer-to-peer protocol. 

## Gateway device
Device acting as receiver will be simultaneously be listening for messages broadcasted to it's MAC address using ESP-NOW & connected to WiFi to send MQTT messages to a broker. 

# Installation

Clone repository and navigate into folder:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kevinmidboe/hivemonitor-esp32-firmware
cd hivemonitor-esp32-firmware
```

## TL;DR

Flash microcontroller:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glenn20/micropython-espnow-images/main/20230427-v1.20.0-espnow-2-gcc4c716f6/firmware-esp32-GENERIC.bin > firmware-esp32-espnow.bin
make flash file=firmware-esp32-espnow.bin device=/dev/tty.usbserial-02899247
```
Upload source code:
```bash
make sender device=/dev/tty.usbserial-02899247
# or
make gateway device=/dev/tty.usbserial-02899247
```

## Flashing firmware
The current supported flashing tool for micropython firmware is esptool.py. You can find this tool here: https://github.com/espressif/esptool/, or install it using pip:

```bash
pip install esptool
```

Download firmware from [supported firmware linked below](#firmware-sources) or compile required micropython with libraries listed below:
- espnow
- usocket
- umqtt.simple

Plug esp32 into computers USB and find it's connected TTY port with:

```bash
ls -l /dev/tty.*
```

Erase the existing firmware and then deploy the new firmware using:
```bash
make flash device=/dev/tty.usbserial-02899247
```

## Uploading application source files

For uploading source files we can use adafruit ampy CLI found at https://github.com/espressif/esptool, or installed with pip:

```bash
pip install adafruit-ampy
```

Upload all files for ESP32 that will be acting as a `gateway` by running:

```bash
make gateway
```

Upload all files for ESP32 that will be acting as a `sensor reader & sender` by running:

```bash
make sender
```

# Setup

After uploading source files, use the on-board MODE switch to side marked "Setup" device to boot board into setup mode. Inputs will b based on if device is setup as `sender` or `gateway`.

After setting mode switch and resetting the controller will be discoverable as a WiFi access point serving a configuration page.
 1. Connect to WiFi network prefixed with `ESP-AP-`
 2. Open browser to http://192.168.0.4

Below shows screenshots of gateway device in setup mode:

ðŸŽ‰ Setup completed!  
When both a sender and gateway is setup MQTT messages should start reaching broker.

## Networking
There are two WiFi interfaces, STA mode is workstation mode (ESP32 is connected to the router)ï¼ŒAP mode provides access services (other devices connected to ESP32).


The ESP32 does not have two antennas, but we can run two interfaces `STA` & `AP`. The drawback of this is that since we only have one antenna we need to make sure the sending and receiving devices are both broadcasting on same channel. In a sitation where your WiFi access point might be brodcasting on channel e.g. 6 the ESP32 connects over WiFi on this channel. The ESP32 sending sensor data therefor needs to be broadcasting data over ESP-NOW on same channel.
